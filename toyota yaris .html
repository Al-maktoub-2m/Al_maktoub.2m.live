            <h2>  Toyota Yaris TS 133 ch (2007 – 2010) with 6 100 $</h2>
            <p>The Toyota Yaris is a popular compact car manufactured by the Japanese automaker Toyota since 1999. It is available in many versions, each with its own features and options. Here are some additional details about the different versions of the Toyota Yaris:

                <p> L: The Yaris L is the base version of the Toyota Yaris. It is equipped with a 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 106 horsepower. The car comes with a six-speed manual transmission or a six-speed automatic transmission.

                                    <div class="image">
                                        <img src="assets/images/TOYATA YARRIS TS.png" alt="">
                                    </div>
        
                                    <p>More dynamic than truly sporty, the second-generation Yaris TS reconciles beautiful performance with great compactness, giving it a rare versatility while remaining pleasant and reliable! Toyota succeeded with its first Yaris, launched in 1998. Nicely designed, solidly built in France, it was very successful. Its descendant, revealed at the 2005 Frankfurt Motor Show and still assembled in Onnaing, capitalizes on the qualities that so pleased customers: very compact bodywork to facilitate parking, clever interior with a sliding bench, nice look, and serious manufacturing.

            Besides, the category is not the same, with the Toyota being priced much lower when it was released in February 2007: €16,580 for the 3-door version, which is equivalent to €20,500 today according to INSEE. For an additional €1,500, one can purchase the 5-door version. The equipment is complete: automatic air conditioning, MP3 radio, 17-inch alloy wheels, keyless start, ESP, electric windows and mirrors. As an option, GPS, rear parking sensor, or Bluetooth are available. However, the Suzuki Swift Sport, which already offers 125 hp, is €1,000 cheaper.
            
            Despite this, Toyota did not have high commercial ambitions for the Yaris TS, hoping to sell only a small thousand units annually in France. It disappeared at the end of 2010 when the Yaris was renewed.
            However, it wasn't until late 2006 that the TS sport version was introduced. It swaps the 105 hp 1.5 L engine of its predecessor for a 133 hp 1.8 L engine. This naturally aspirated engine uses two continuously variable camshaft phasers (double VVTi system) to develop its horsepower, at a reasonable engine speed of 6,000 rpm. The maximum torque of 173 Nm is reached at 4,400 rpm, which is rather high, but the Franco-Japanese car weighs only 1,120 kg. As a result, the 0 to 100 km/h time of 9.3 seconds seems quite interesting, even though the Yaris TS will not challenge a Renault Clio III RS, naturally.
            <p>
            
            <h3>What to watch out for?
            
           <p> Like many Toyotas, the Yaris TS is known for its great reliability, provided it has been properly maintained. Its engine, equipped with a chain drive, does not suffer from any notable flaws, nor does its gearbox.
            
            However, recalls have taken place concerning the steering column, sound insulation, or accelerator pedal. There have also been a few cases of oxidized ABS sensors, but nothing serious. Overall, few city cars, especially sporty ones, provide such a serene driving experience as this Yaris!
            
            Behind the wheel
            
            Onboard the Toyota Yaris 1.8 TS, one is not particularly impressed by the appearance of the plastics. Still, the functionality of the dashboard, containing three closed storage compartments and water bottle holders, is impressive!
            In the back, one appreciates the sliding bench seat and the double-floor trunk, even though space is just average. In the front, one enjoys an excellent driving position (adjustable steering wheel in both planes) and a comfortable seat.
            How much does it cost?
            
            The Yaris TS does not lose much value and can be found in good condition for as low as €5,800, with more than 150,000 km on the clock. At €6,500, the mileage drops to around 100,000 km, while at €7,500, one can get a car with approximately 80,000 km.
            <p> 
                <h3>Which version should you choose?
            
                    <p> As the choice is limited to 3- or 5-door versions, it is a matter of personal preference.
            As the choice is limited to 3- or 5-door versions, it is a matter of personal preference.
            
            Collector versions
            
            As usual, the ones in perfect original condition, with low mileage (less than 30,000 km), will be the most sought-after. They are very rare.
            
            
            
            <p>           The engine is lively and also stands out for its flexibility in the city, combined with a certain smoothness, like the gearbox. On the road, it ensures good acceleration, even in 5th gear, but you have to wait until you reach 4,000 rpm to get some character. Nothing like the block of a Swift Sport, much more aggressive.
            
            And since the final ratio is short (31.8 km/h per 1,000 rpm), the Yaris is quite noisy on the highway, even though it remains very tolerable. The chassis is on a par with the engine: efficient but not very sporty. The Toyota will gently place its tail if you force it during cornering entry and will show some agility, but above all it is cautious. In short, it is a fast little GT, very homogeneous, versatile, and relatively comfortable, despite a logically firm suspension. Moreover, it brakes very well and consumes relatively little: 7.5 l/100 km.
            
            <h3> Youngtimer alternative
                <p>
            Transmission: 5-speed manual, front-wheel drive<br>
            
            Power: 133 hp at 6,000 rpm<br>
            
            Torque: 174 Nm at 4,400 rpm<br>

            0 to 100 km/h: 9.3 s (manufacturer data)<br>
            
            <h3>Toyota Yaris 1.5 TS (2001 - 2006)
            
                <p>As the first slightly sporty Yaris, the TS emphasizes vitality rather than pure performance, with its 106 hp. And it works: it is very fun to drive, more so than its descendant. On the other hand, it falls far short in terms of comfort, soundproofing, and equipment.
            
            In other words, it will be more rewarding than the second-generation TS in sporty driving but more tiring in daily use. Fortunately, it is very reliable, although it will be slightly more vulnerable to corrosion due to its age. Slightly restyled in 2003, it can be purchased starting from €3,000.
